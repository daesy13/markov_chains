Would you could you in a house?
Would you could you with a mouse?
Would you could you in a box?
Would you could you with a fox?
Would you like green eggs and ham?
Would you like them, Sam I am?
Would you like apples or oranges?
Would you like to go to the beach?
Could you live in a house with a mouse?
There is suspicious in September.
Where would you be, if not here and when would you be if not there?
